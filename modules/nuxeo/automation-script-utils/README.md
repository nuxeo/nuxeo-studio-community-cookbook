# Automation Script utilities

## Prerequisites

- None

## Description

Miscellaneous utilities to be used with JS Automation.

## Usage

Look at the script you need and copy/paste it in your Studio project. The comments in the "header" explain how to use it.

- Make sure to set the `input`  and the `output` of your script as expected in the comments.
- Don't forget to explicitly declare the parameter(s). They also are described in the comments.
- Also, some of these scripts use "Java in JS", which requires to white list the Java API that is used inside JS. When this occurs, the header will contain the XML to add (create a new XML extension in Studio, copy/paste the XMl declaration)
